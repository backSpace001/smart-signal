Red Signal Alerting for car using Wireless Communication 

It is very difficult to constantly keep track of every visual signal for the driver. So here I propose an automatic alerting system that alerts the driver of any red signal ahead. My system works on the basis of Rf technology. Whenever a signal turns red, it sets on an rf transmitter fitted in it. The transmitter constantly transmits rf signals informing about a red signal. Now every car needs an receiver circuit on it. The receiver circuit when comes within certain range of the rf transmitter, it receives the input and sends it to the microcontroller. The microcontroller then processes this data in order to alert the driver about the signal ahead.
